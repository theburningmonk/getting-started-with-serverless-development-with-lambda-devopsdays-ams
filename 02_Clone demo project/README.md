# Module 2: Clone demo project

<details>
<summary><b>Clone and deploy the demo project</b></summary><p>

1. Fork this [repo](https://github.com/theburningmonk/getting-started-with-serverless-development-with-lambda-devopsdays-ams-demo)

and clone it on your laptop

2. Open the repo in your IDE

3. Run `npm install`

4. Open `serverless.yml`, on ln 4, replace the `<INSERT NAME HERE>` placeholder with your name, and on ln 5, replace the `<INSERT EMAIL HERE>` placeholder with your email (for receiving SNS notification when you place an order in the app)

For this demo, we'll simulate sending a push notification via SNS. To keep things simple, we'll deliver the notification by email instead.

5. Deploy the demo project

`npm run sls -- deploy`

you should see console output like the following

Open the first `GET` endpoint in the browser, you should see something like this

<summary><b>Seed the DynamoDB table</b></summary><p>

1. Open `seed-restaurants.js`, on ln 1, replace the `<INSERT NAME HERE>` placeholder with your name. This should match what you used in the `serverless.yml` in the previous step.

2. Run the script

`STAGE=dev REGION=eu-west-1 node seed-restaurants.js`

and go to the landing page again, you should now see some restaurants

Congratulations! You have deployed a serverless project with:

* a `GET /` endpoint that returns the landing page HTML
* a `GET /restaurants` endpoint that returns a default list of restaurants
* a `POST /restaurants/search` endpoint to search restaurants by theme
* a `POST /orders` endpoint to place an order and publishes an `order_placed` event into a Kinesis stream
* a `notify-restaurant` restaurant function that reacts to the `order_placed` event and publishes a push notification to SNS

This is how things look from a high level:

But, this project is not worthy of production yet, because:

* there are no tests at all
* it's logging with `console.log`
* there's no way to disable debug logging in production
* we can't correlate log messages across multiple functions
* we don't have visibility into what's happening inside the function to debug performance issues
* all the functions share the same IAM role, so they all have too much permission
